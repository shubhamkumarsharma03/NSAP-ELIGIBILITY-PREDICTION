# NSAP-ELIGIBILITY-PREDICTION
This project leverages IBM Watsonx.ai to automate the classification of NSAP applications using machine learning. The objective is to develop a multi-class classification model that predicts the most appropriate NSAP scheme—such as IGNOAPS (Old Age Pension), IGNWPS (Widow Pension), or IGNDPS —based on demographic and socio-economic features.
